# Dimensionality Reduction

_To reduce the number of features_

## Goals :-
- identify Pattern in data
- Detect corelation
- Reduce the dimension
- feature extraction

## Uses :-
- Noise filtering
- Visualization
- Stock Market data prediction

## Algo's used are :-
- PCA(Principal Component Analysis)
- LDA(Linear Discrimant Analysis)
  

## PCA

- Used for unsupervised learning
- from the m indepedent variables of our datasets, PCA extracts p <= m new indepedent variables that explain the most of the variance of the dataset regardless of the depedent variables.

## LDA

- different from PCA - Seperation
- used in the pre processing step for pattern classification
- used for supervised learning
- has the goal to project the dataset onto a lower dimensional space
- from the m indepedent variables of our datasets, PCA extracts p <= m new indepedent variables that seperate the most the classes of the depedent variables.
